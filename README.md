# Construcion-website

A website made from Next.js + React-Bootstrap

## What I learned
- `document` is not availale on server-side rendering as it only exists in client-side - browser
- React-bootstrap uses React components with Bootstrap styling, but i can also add a className to a component to use pure Bootstrap library
- 

## Future features
- persistent data CRUD operations with mySQL or MongoDB
- authentication integration with nextjs
